</div>

<p class='c007'>Westport, Connecticut,—that he boarded at
No. 24 Bleecker street, with Mrs. Mallory,
and that he was a clerk for Perkins, Hopkins,
and White, in Pearl street, near Hanover
Square. I carried some beautiful books to his
place of business, and requested him to accept
them. He sweetly smiled, and opened the
books, and warmly thanked me, and said he
would be pleased to receive them, but that as
I was a stranger, he would rather I would see
his guardian, Morris Ketchum, a Banker in
Wall street, and give him my name and address,
and if he were satisfied with my references,
and approved of his acceptance of the
generous gift, he would be most happy to
receive the books. I was fascinated with his
modesty, and caution, and I took the books,
and repaired to the Banking House of Mr.
Ketchum, to whom I briefly imparted what
had transpired, and left my references and
departed, and called again, when Mr. Ketchum
said that he had inquired respecting my character,
and that young Jesup was prepared to
receive my books, which I soon placed in his
hands, and our acquaintance began under the
most favorable auspices. I soon invited him
to dine with me at Mrs. Tripler’s, when all
the boarders were enchanted with his beautiful
person, and pleasing manners, and highly
cultivated mind; and I shall never forget how
proud I was, as he sat beside me. After dinner,
I invited him to my room, where I gave him
cake and lemonade, and filled his pockets with
delicious oranges. I then played “Washington’s
March,” “Yankee Doodle,” and “Hail
Columbia,” for him on the piano, and he departed
for his place of business. He went
with me to Niblo’s Garden, then in its glory,
and as we strolled arm-in-arm in the meandering
paths, and inhaled the exhilarating
perfume of the flowers, I was charmed with
his chaste society, and enraptured and inspired,
and I breathed the music of language in his
ears, and we both were invested with the
purest and loftiest and happiest emotions. In
a week from that joyous evening, he was
seized with bleeding of the lungs, caused by
excited feelings, during his enthusiastic efforts
to please his employers, in the sleepless business
season of early autumn. He was borne
to his mother’s abode in the country, where
he soon calmly resigned his soul to the Saviour,
whose sacred virtues he had always
strove to imitate. Although I had briefly
enjoyed the pleasure of his society, yet his
premature demise created a void in my bosom
that made the world a desolation. His mother
soon removed to New York, and occupied No.
39 Bond street, where I gratuitously taught
her children in English and the classics. But
the invisible germ of consumption has borne
to the grave her pure, intelligent, and lovely
Caroline, Charles, Richard, and Frederick,
and Morris, Arthur, Samuel, and Sarah
anticipate the same remorseless destiny.
And may God cheer and bless their mother
in her loneliness and tears. The father
of this interesting and unfortunate family,
was prostrated in the commercial crash
of 1837, and his depressed and spotless soul
fled for refuge to the bosom of his God.
Morris Ketchum was his early business associate
and friend, and has educated his children,
procured them lucrative clerkships, afforded
them facilities to visit nearly every nation,
for health and general culture, established
them in houses of commerce, and
has clung to them, in sun and storm, like
Pythias to Damon, and like Washington to his
country. At this period of my eventful career,
I taught colored and Irish servants, and those
of all countries, in their kitchens in the evening,
and sometimes by daylight. Some paid
me one shilling a lesson, and some two, according
to their wages and generosity. I
taught the servants of the Reverend Doctor
Wainright, the Reverend Doctor Orville
Dewey, Daniel Lord, James T. Brady, Mr.
Bowen, of Brooklyn, (of the firm of Bowen &amp;
McNamee, of New York,) and the servants of
other distinguished citizens. I obtained scholars
by going from door to door, in the basement,
and asking the servants if they would
like to learn to spell, read, write, and cipher.
My health had been miserable since I left
Columbian College, and I often expected to
fall dead in the street, or suddenly expire in
the presence of my pupils. For a long period
after young Jesup died, I was very gloomy,
and became utterly helpless and bed-ridden,
and called oftener on my father for money
than I desired, to pay for board and medical
attendance. I got better, and crawled out
into the open air, and went in pursuit of scholars
in a snow storm. I began at the Battery,
and applied at every door, until I came to
No. 70 Greenwich street, when I was asked to
come in and warm myself, by a daughter of
the lady of the house, who kept boarders.
After a long conversation, by a cheerful fire,
I was engaged to teach the daughter in the
English branches, for my breakfast and tea,
and a very small dark room as a place of lodging,
which I could not conveniently occupy
without a candle in the day time. Humble
as were to be my accommodations, my feelings
were extremely buoyant, and my ghastly
form trembled with delight at my unexpected
resurrection from the depths of indigence and
despair. Mr. Ditchett, (subsequently a very
efficient Captain of the Fourth Ward Police,
and a brave fireman, and an honest man,) had
just married the eldest daughter, whose sister
was to be my pupil. I was kindly treated,
and remained until the first of May, when I
went to Dey street, and afterwards to the
Graham House, at No. 63 Barclay street,
where I saw the lean Horace Greeley,
one of the founders of the Graham System.
The boarders were mostly skeletons, and
several were limping about the house, like
frogs or lizzards or grasshoppers, and among
the limpers, was Horace Greeley, who had
what the Grahamites called a boiling crisis,
or crisis of boils, which was the result of
youthful indiscretion, shower bathing, and
eating heartily of bran bread, mush and molasses,
squashes, turnips, beets, carrots, parsneps,
and onions, for a long term of years.
Although I had been a miserable invalid a
large portion of my days, yet I fancied a speedy
restoration to health, by eating unbolted
wheat bread and vegetables, and frequent
bathing. I entered into a spirited conversation
with Greeley, who was reclining on the
sofa, and in a loquacious mood, who told me
that he expected to be quite smart after the
disappearance of a large number of boils then
all over his person, which he attributed to salt
rheum, that he inherited from his father, and
which was recently driven to the surface of
his skin by a rigid adherence to the Graham
System, and three shower baths a day; and he
advised me to begin to bathe immediately, and
to eat nothing but Graham bread for one
month, with warm water, milk, and sugar. I
asked Greeley if he was sure it was the
secondary or inherited salt rheum that had
come to the surface of his snowy flesh in the
form of boils, and he said he was quite sure it
was, as his father had it from his boyhood. I
asked him if his secondary or inherited salt
rheum ever itched, and he said yes, sometimes,
but he was sure it was not the secondary
itch, as he never had the first itch. I then
looked him dead in the eye, and asked him if
he was positively sure his boils were not the
result of itch, and he asked me what I meant
by such severity of scrutiny. I replied, that
I once had the itch, and read many books on
the subject, and knew all about it, and that
his boils (he had two on his pale nose) looked
very much like secondary itch blossoms. He
cast searching glances, and sat in paralytic
silence, save when he scratched his boils, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>the bell summoned me to my first Graham
dinner, and Greeley hopped to the table on
one leg, and sat near Mrs. Goss at the head of
the Graham festive board. About forty
skeletons were present, and among them were
Sylvester Graham (Bread,) himself, on a
lecturing tour from his country seat at Northampton;
John McCracken, of New Haven;
Ralph Waldo Emerson; Abby Kelly; Fred
Douglas and lady; Francis Copcutt, mahogany
dealer, who used to eat raw oats, and ride 30
miles a day on a hard trotting horse for dyspepsia;
Jeremiah O. Lanphear, tailor, and
now first deacon and missionary of the Fulton
street Dutch Presbyterian Church, who had
a gravel nearly as large as General Winfield
Scott’s, which was the largest that ever
emanated from a human bladder; Mrs. Farnham,
the accomplished lady and genuine philanthropist,
and wife of the noble and famous
California traveler, who was the rival of
Fremont as a mountaineer; Mrs. Anna Stephens,
the fertile and genial authoress; the
celebrated Doctor Shew and lady; Mrs. Storms,
of Troy, and long a writer and foreign correspondent
of the <cite>New York Sun</cite>, and now of
Texas; poor MacDonald Clark, the poet; Galutia
B. Smith; Matthew B. Brady, the daguerreotypist,
who married his sweetheart at the
Graham House, and the room being crowded,
I saw the exercises through the key hole;
Mrs. Travis; Albert Brisbane, a moonlight
dreamer; Mrs. Andrews, a strong Unitarian,
(ninety-eight years old,) and her grandson,
Albert L. Smith, a nervous and catarrhal
gentleman, who now keeps a Graham House
and Water Cure Establishment in West Washington
Place; Dr. John Burdell, brother of
Dr. Harvey Burdell, who was assasinated at
No. 31 Bond Street; Leroy Sunderland, a
Mesmeriser and Pathetic lecturer; John M.
King; George Foss; Dr. Henry W. Brown;
E. Gould Buffum, and his brother, William
Buffum, now Consul at <i>Trieste</i>; Mrs. Horace
Greeley; Mr. Clutz; Mrs. Van Vleet;
Messrs. Tyler, Bennett, (a tailor), Otis, and
Ward; Mrs. Gove; C. Edwards Lester; Mr.
Danforth, a spurious reformer; the brothers
Fowler, phrenologists; father Miller, the Millenium
impostor; Mr. Seymour, a journeyman
hatter at Beebe’s, who got among the noisy
methodists, who frightened him into a dangerous
nervous affection, and in bed one night,
poor Seymour felt cold and strange and numb,
and pinched himself in the arms and legs, and
it didn’t hurt him, and he thought he was dead,
and he got up, and kindled a match, and lit a
candle, and looked in the glass to see whether
he was dead or alive, and when he saw his
eyes roll, and his jaws open and close, he got
into bed, and went to sleep. This was the
gang at table, and for dinner, we had bran
bread and crackers, bean soup, roast apples
and potatoes, and boiled squash and carrots,
but not a particle of meat, grease, nor spices.
All grabbed violently at the Graham viands,
and brought their teeth together like swine,
and with similar grunts and squeals. I calmly
surveyed the motley and hungry group, and
saw many small piercing gray eyes, hollow
cheeks, and sharp chins and noses, and
the voices of nearly all were husky and
fearfully sepulchral. The themes discussed
were Anti-Slavery and Grahamism,
and I soon perceived it extremely perilous to
breathe a word against the ultra views of
the susceptible and long-haired Graham
spectres, who seemed united to a ghost
on these prolific themes. So, I listened and
breathed not a syllable in opposition to the
crazy views advanced. I took a stroll after
dinner, and returned at sunset, and seated
myself for my evening meal, when we had
Graham-bread-coffee, milk porridge, apple
sauce, Graham mush, and boiled rice, sparingly
saturated with molasses and liquid ginger.
I ate and drank freely of this light food,
and arose from the table in excellent spirits,
though I belched frequently. My belly soon
began to swell, and I got alarmed, and I
asked Mr. Goss, the Graham host, what it
meant. He seemed perfectly cool, and said
that his boarders were often affected in that
way, in passing suddenly from greasy meats to
the pure food of Grahamites, which was
chiefly of a vegetable and somewhat of a
gassy and flatulent character. Goss then left
me. I thrice paced the parlor hurriedly, and
began to feel choleric and crampy, and went
down stairs into the kitchen, and asked Goss
to send for a physician immediately, which he
declined to do, as he thought I was only a
little spleeny, which would soon pass away,
and advised me to go to bed. He got me a
Graham candle, and up we went, and did not
stop until we reached the roof, where he put
me in a little room, with two cots, on which
there was a straw mattress, and a straw
bolster, and scanty covering. He said good
night, and shut the door, and I got into bed,
and strove to sleep. I squirmed like an eel
for about two hours, and could endure my
pains no longer, and arose and awoke my
room-mate, and asked him to escort me to
the sleeping apartment of Mr. Goss. He did
so, and I knocked at his door, and out he came
in his nightcap and white apparel. I told
him that I had cramps, and had an awful
quantity of frantic wind in my stomach,
and felt as though my belly would burst
before morning, and that I was deathly sick,
and asked him what on earth I had eaten at
his table to give me such violent cramps and
flatulence and diarrhœa, and nauseous and
strange emotions. He told me that I was
nervous, and not accustomed to Graham food,
but that I soon would be, and urged me to
again retire, and strive to sleep. He spoke
these words with kindness, and they soothed
me, and I shook his hand, and off I went up
stairs to bed again. But in about ten minutes,
I had a severe spasm, with choking sensations,
and I leaped from my nest like a man in his
last gasp, and unconsciously cast myself on
the cot of my room-mate, who instantly emerged
from a profound sleep, and sprang like a
tiger from his bed, and threw me severely to
the floor, and cried murder to the pinnacle of
his voice, and began to pelt me in the most
brutal manner, leveling the most savage random
blows at my head and stomach. Goss and
the spectral boarders rushed into the room,
and Greeley soon came limping in, and they
searched in vain for knives, revolvers, and
human blood. And they soon learned the
cause of the cry of murder, and raised me from
the floor, and put me into bed, with a bloody
nose and dark eye, that my room-mate gave
me, who apologised for his blows on the ground
that he always slept soundly, and was only
partially awake when he beat me. I accepted
his apology, and Goss and Greeley, and half-a-dozen
attenuated Grahamites left me, for
their beds again, and my chum took a seat by
my cot, and strove to soothe me. But the
cramps returned, and I became faint and giddy,
and began to vomit profusely. I soon filled
basins, pitchers, spit boxes, hats, and boots,
and deluged every thing we had in the room,
and my chum got a pitcher and basin in the
next room, and I soon flooded them, and I
vomited until I thought I felt my entire bowels
struggling at my throat to get out, which
nearly strangled me. At last an enormous
chunk came out, which proved to be the core
of a stewed apple, and the crust of Graham
bread combined into a sort of petrified substance,
and I began to breathe again, and
slowly improved till daylight,</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='blunt' class='c006'>Supervisor Blunt, and Paul Julien—My Last Interview with Madame Sontag.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>When I taught Alderman Orison Blunt the
English branches at his elegant residence in
Murray street, I gave instruction to Paul
Julien, the juvenile Paganini, and to Rocco,
and also to Madame Sontag in elocution, in
anticipation of her appearance in English
Opera at Niblo’s, on her return from Mexico.
At the close of a long and interesting lesson,
Sontag opened her great heart to me, and disclosed
her career from her earliest recollection.
Her narrative was eloquent and exciting,
and as she sat before me at the parlor
lattice, in alternate tears and smiles, with the
moon rolling like a ball of silver through the
air, she seemed too pure and beautiful for
earth. Her tears were the very soul of sorrow,
and none could resist their overwhelming
influence,—her smiles were irresistibly
enchanting,—her voice in conversation was
full of entrancing melody,—her cavern dimples
were the emblems of purity and charity,
and her entire expression was divine. And as
her blood warmed, and her bosom rose and
fell, and her voice trembled and darted from
the faintest whisper to its highest intonation,
her glorious eyes reflected gorgeous temples
in her soul, filled with sinless angels, breathing
sweet music to millions of her species.
And the beauteous Sontag told me, as we sat
together in our last communion as human pilgrims,
that her childhood, and girlhood, and
early womanhood were all devoted to the
cultivation of music for the enjoyment of the
world more than herself, which rendered her
early years an utter sacrifice, and had
deprived her of the pastimes enjoyed by all
her sex in the morning of life; that from the
hour she was called “<i>The little Daughter of
the Danube</i>,” there was no happiness for her;
that she was early beset by lovers from nearly
every nation of Europe; that kings and queens
lavished their choicest treasures upon her;
that princes besought her affections in tearful
supplications; that all France prostrated herself
at her feet; that amid the flattery and
adulations of all classes and kingdoms, she
was induced, in a thoughtless hour, to cast
herself into the eternal embraces of a being
who proved a jealous and savage tyrant, and
a heartless gamester; that ere her emergence
from the brief hours of bliss that should
follow the marriage vow, he became odious in
her eyes, and she beheld a life of misery in all
her future; that after years of torture in his
demon fangs, and after he had squandered her
splendid fortune of four millions of dollars, he
dragged her from the sacred precincts of private
life, and from the pleasing society of her
children, into the public arena, to toil for his
subsistence; that he forced her to exchange
hemispheres, and leave her tender offspring,
when they most required a mother’s protection;
that he often brandished a dagger in her
eyes, when she refused to fill his purse for
bibbling and gaming purposes; that she was
in fear of his poignard throughout her long
confinement in his hideous clutches; that for
his traduction and persecution of Alboni in
her early years, she resolved to pursue her to
America to annoy, and, if possible, ruin her,
for his sake, by singing against her in the
leading cities; that on the very day she publicly
announced her intention to visit America,
Alboni went to the Cathedral, and knelt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>at the altar, and swore that she would pursue
her through all latitudes, and cut the grass
beneath her feet, to avenge herself on Count
Rossi, who strove to blight the buds and
blossoms of her youth and indigence; that
she kept her oath, and followed her through
city, town, and village, and allured her choristers,
through extravagant salaries and donations,
and sang on the evenings of her Concert
and Opera entertainments, and greatly reduced
her receipts; that Rossi seized her funds,
as they accrued, and deposited them in banks
unknown to her; that her children often
wrote in vain for means to defray their
domestic expenses; that Rossi, and Maretzek,
and Ullman received all the benefit of her
arduous labors; that her lovely daughters
were in the care of strangers in Europe, and
exposed to all the snares of life; that their
education was fatally neglected in her absence;
that she was a slave to Rossi, Maretzek,
and Ullman, all of whom she thoroughly
despised, and that she had very seriously contemplated
suicide. And thus did this celestial
being breathe her pensive music in my
soul, and bathe my vision with nature’s hallowed
waters. And amid our mutual tears,
and smiles, and cheerful tones, and lingering
glances, she enters the dismal cars, and the
bell proclaims the parting signal, and she
penetrates the deep perspective, until she is
forever buried from my melancholy view.
She gives concerts on the borders of the northern
lakes, and visits Cincinnati, and quarrels
and separates from Ullman, and goes to New
Orleans, and performs in Opera, and enters
Mexico, amid the revengeful maledictions of
Ullman, who, as Rocco told me, dug her early
grave, by arousing the fearful jealousy of
Rossi, to whom Ullman wrote from New York,
that he would find letters in her trunk from
Pozzolini, the young and fascinating tenor;
that Rossi did find letters in her trunk from
Pozzolini, (filled with the most enthusiastic
love,) which Rocco said were doubtless placed
there by Ullman, prior to her departure for
Mexico, to revenge himself on Sontag, for her
refusal at Cincinnati to give more Concerts
under his direction; that Rossi belched words
of fire, and threatened her with instant death;
that herself and Pozzolini were seized with
violent pains, on their return from the Mexican
festivals; that during her confinement,
Rocco daily called, but was not permitted to
see her; that Rossi paced the balcony as a
sentinel for days and nights, and would let no
one visit her; that he permitted Rocco to
enter her apartment only one hour before she
died, when he found her in the wildest delirium.
And Rocco told me that Sontag and
Pozzolini were doubtless poisoned by Count
Rossi, and that Ullman was the instigator.
Rossi artfully attributed their sudden death
to cholera, but the rumor flew on the wings
of lightning, that Rossi was their murderer,
and he fled for his life to New York,
with all her jewels, and went to Europe.
And Rocco sorely grieved to see her borne
to her sepulchre without kindred mourners
in a far distant land; and when he
saw her form exhumed, and borne through
mud and stones, and deposited as luggage in
the filthy suburbs of Vera Cruz, and exposed
for weeks to the heat and rain of those withering
latitudes,—when he gazed at the remains
of a being who had been the pride and glory
and adoration of all civilised nations, and who
had long been his own dear friend, poor Rocco
prostrated himself beside her coffin, and wept
for hours in loneliness and utter desolation.
And now, dear Sontag, I can see thy pure and
genial spirit in its happy home, beyond the
pretty stars. And while I indite these melancholy
words, thy sweet face smiles upon me
from my parlor wall, as you appeared in the
immortal <cite>Somnambulist</cite>. It is the likeness you
gave me at our final interview, and represents
<i>Amina</i>, in the joyous bridal scene with <i>Elvino</i>,
among her native cottagers in the mountains.
All! Sontag! I often think of thee, and my
highest solace is in gazing at thy bewitching
smile, and laughing eyes, and lovely dimples,
and even teeth, and classic temples, as depicted
in thy likeness, which I shall keep while
I linger in the dreary paths of earth. And I
will part with fame and fortune and with life
itself, ere I will separate from the precious
picture of my adored Sontag. And my last
prayer to God shall be, that I may join my
Parents and Kindred and Sontag in the realms
of eternal bliss.</p>

    <div>BENNETT’S OFFICE IN 1835.</div>
    <div class='c000'><i>Enter John Kelly.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><i>Bennett</i>—Well, my lad, I have borrowed a
pair of old shoes for you from my bed-fellow
in Cross street. They may be rather large,
but you must contrive to wear them until
Saturday, when I will get you a new pair, if
I have the money to spare. Sit down, Johnny,
and try on the shoes.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>John</i> (puts them on)—They are much too
large, aint they?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Bennett</i>—Well, yes, but if you put some
pieces of newspaper in them, you can lessen
their size.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>John</i> (stuffs them in the heels and toes and
sides with fragments of the <cite>Herald</cite> of the
preceding day)—There, sir, I guess I can wear
them now, and I am truly obliged to you for
borrowing them for me.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Bennett</i>—Not at all, John, for you did more
than that for me yesterday, in obtaining my
papers from Mr. Anderson.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>John</i> (in hurriedly walking across the
office, steps out of one of the aged shoes, but
steps in again before Bennett’s keen eyes perceived
that one foot had stepped out)—That
was a great pleasure, sir, and I hope you will
have the same good luck to-day.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Bennett</i>—I sold very few papers yesterday,
and I have very little money, and Anderson
has my watch, and I fear he will not let me
have the papers until I redeem it, and pay him
for the <cite>Heralds</cite> of to-day.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>John</i>—I will do all in my power to obtain
them for you.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Bennett</i>—I know you will, my dear little
friend. But come—we will go and try to get
the papers. (They arrive at Anderson &amp;
Ward’s, in Ann street. Anderson is absent,
and Ward is partially drunk and asleep on the
counter, and Bennett arouses him.)</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Ward</i>—What are you about? (rubbing his
eyes and garrping.) What do you want (hic)
so early in the morning, you vagabonds?
hic, hec, hoc.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Bennett</i>—I want my papers.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Ward</i>—You can’t (hic) have them without
the money, (hoc.)</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Bennett</i>—Please let me have them.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Ward</i>—Where’s your (hic) watch?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Bennett</i>—I let Mr. Anderson have it yesterday.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Ward</i>—Don’t you (hic-a-che-a-che-Horatio-darn
it, how I sneeze) sell any <cite>Heralds</cite> now-a-days?
a-che-a-che-a-che-Horatio—O, Jerusalem!
will I never stop sneezing?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Bennett</i>—It stormed yesterday, and I did
not sell many, but it is pleasant this morning,
and I think I shall sell a large number.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Ward</i>—Well, I’ll not be (hic, hic, hic,) too
hard with you, old fellow. There, take your
papers, and try hard (hic) to sell (hic) them
to-day, and (hic-a-che) bring a whole lot
of money to (hic) morrow.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Bennett</i>—I will, Mr. Ward, and I’ll always
remember you with gratitude for your generosity
to-day. Good day, sir.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Ward</i>—Farewell, old boy. And just shut
the door alter you. I have been (hic) on a
spree all night, (hec,) and I don’t want anybody
else to come in and bother (hic) me,
until I finish my nap.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Bennett</i>—I’ll lock the door outside, and put
the key in the window.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Ward</i>—Do so, old (hic) boy, do so. (And
he goes to sleep, and Bennett and John wend
their way to Wall street.)</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Bennett</i>—Now, John, this is the last chance
I shall have. If I fail to sell my papers to-day,
I am ruined for ever.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>John</i>—Had I not better go into the stores,
and try to sell the papers.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Bennett</i> (kisses him in Nassau street)—My
dear boy, if you will do that, I will love you
next to my God. My great trouble has been
to get honest boys to sell my paper, and return
the money to me, instead of going to the
Theatre and eating peanuts with my funds.
Now, you take some, and I’ll take some, and
you take one side of the street and I the other,
and let us toil for our lives (until the sun goes
down) to sell these papers, and, if we fail, my
fate is sealed for time, and perhaps for eternity!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>John</i>—What! You won’t commit suicide?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Bennett</i>—God only knows what I shall do.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>John</i>—Well, I see there’s no time to be lost.
So, give me some papers, and I’ll go into the
first store on this side, and you take the other
side of the street. (They separate, John going
into every store on his side, and Bennett into
every store on the other side, until they arrive
at Wall street, when they go into Bennett’s
office, in the old rat hole at No. 20 Wall street,
where they count their pennies, and find that
they have sold quite a large number of <cite>Heralds</cite>.
They then drink some water and eat
some ginger nuts, for their breakfasts, and go
down Broad street, and enter every store on
either side, and meet with great success. John
then takes South street, and Bennett Front
street, from the Battery to Fulton street, and
afterwards take Water and Pearl streets, and
then they canvass either side of Wall street,
and sell all their <cite>Heralds</cite>, and go to a Restaurant
and get something to eat, and separate in
the afternoon in high spirits. John then got
some boys in the Fourteenth Ward to sell the
<cite>Herald</cite>, and in ten days Bennett had about
$40 surplus, and begins to put on aristocratic
airs, and domineer over Johnny Kelly.)</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Stephen H. Branch</span>:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>:—Permit me the privilege of making a
few brief passing remarks, asking a few questions,
and respectfully suggesting a few hints
as to your weekly publication, the <span class='sc'>Alligator</span>.
Please to attribute any intrusive errors in this
communication as emanating from an inefficient
method of expressing my sentiments, as
my heart is with you whole and entire in
spirit, and, with a few exceptions, to the very
letter, in your laudable endeavor to bring to
light before the open day the hidden villainies
of the many detestable tyrants that have risen
from the very scum of poverty and criminal
degradation, and who now so unaccountably
hold despotic sway <em>under the garb of honorable
industry</em> in every branch of society, to
the unjust injury and oppression of the poor,
humble, but honest man.</p>

<p class='c014'>I am rejoiced to find the <span class='sc'>Alligator</span> creeping
its way to the literary tables of almost
every respectable News Depot in this and the
adjacent cities, piercing its deadly fangs into
the very vitals of every influential thief and
scoundrel, and that the business public are
now availing themselves of the opportunity in
patronising it as an advertising medium, and
I sincerely wish you every success.</p>

<p class='c014'>Wherever I have an opportunity, I endeavor,
indirectly, to pave the way, to introduce
the merits of the <span class='sc'>Alligator</span>, and, as a
matter of course, have to give and take in the
various opinions expressed as to the carniverous
propensities of that astonishing animal,
and the choice objects it pitches into for its
daily food. The opinions and ideas expressed
on the subject are as varied as the colors in
the rainbow. Any man whose past misdeeds
trouble his conscience, dreads the
animal, as he would a drawn sword, lest its
brutal tusks should tear open to public gaze
what he had secretly hoped was unknown
to mortal being.</p>

<p class='c014'>If the crawling reptiles you select to satisfy
the craving appetite of that amphibious animal
(with such extended jaws continually gaping)
are really of such an abhorrent and loathsome
nature as represented by you in such bold relief,
I should never cease lashing their diseased
and ulcerated carcases with whips of
poisoned scorpions, till I purged and purified
their polluted system with wholesome antidotes.
It strikes me that your gormandising
hydra-headed monster can never be satisfied
with common carrion: it seeks for something
more nutritious for its sustenance. It appears
he is like Pharoah’s lean kine—the more he
devours, the thinner he gets, and his rapacity
increases, and what seems so singular is, that
he has abundance of choice prey for ever at
his side, which he selects indiscriminately,
and an untold amount laid up in his store
houses for ages to come.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nothing do I admire more than the free use
of strong and emphatic language to express
our approbation or disapprobation of men’s
actions public or private, and from the general
tenor of your style, and the peculiar advantages
you possess as a scholar, and the unlimited
information you have treasured up as
a man of experience, with regard to public
characters and measures, I feel confident that
you can convert every tooth of the Alligator
into a poisoned arrow that will deal death and
destruction into every particle of air whereever
it wings its flight, and you can more effectively
hit your mark with surer certainty
by avoiding the use of such terms and phrases
as would be looked upon by the general class
of readers, as rather coarse or vulgar; although
I myself consider your style as
purely hieroglyphic, and that your sarcastic
way merely emanates from a proud,
manly, straightforward, bold and independent
above board kind of a spirit than that of
malice, with the view to convey the sentiments
of your mind, in order to express your
strong feeling of detestation and abhorrence
of every unprincipled scoundrel, against whom
your fiery shafts of indignation may happen
to be turned, cutting to the very heart’s core
like a two edged sword.</p>

<p class='c014'>The body of the <span class='sc'>Alligator</span> is too small by
a long shot. It would greatly enhance its
usefulness by being more liberal. Increase its
pages, extend its columns, devote a space to
correspondents, and, if need be, stretch its
stomach so as to afford an opportunity to
others to open their store-houses, and contribute
their quota of similar wholesome food to
the hungry cannibal, in order the better to
assist in the process of digestion.</p>

<div class='c018'>Yours Respectfuly,</div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
